<h1>Sunrise Solo: A Blog</h1>

<h2>4/15/2020</h2>
<p>My brain is floating back to now.  Back to the flowers, back to the sun.  As everyone's plans float out the windows with string of hope attached, hopes we might soon reel the min.  I didn't attach strings to my plans, I just let them go and bent down to pick up new plans because this is a time for renewal.  Today I get to spend the morning outside, and it's cloudy.  Today I am happy to smell the fresh air.  And maybe it will rain and smell like home rain.  Home rain is warm and wet, fishy, and wormy.  It's a rich scent of spring sprinting into summer.  A summer, it seems, I will spend without camping anywhere but my backyard.  A summer, it seems, where I will be caution of visiting family for fear of getting them sick.  A summer, it seems, of closed parks, closed bike paths, closed malls, and open hearts.  And homebodies soaking it all in, rain or shine.</p>

<h2>2/25/2020</h2>
<p>The door to a new day opens before my tired eyes.  Into a room full of locked doors and darkness I am not looking up.  I’m banging on the doors.  And I know I’m crazy for not using my wings.  But they feel so heavy, damp and sad.  Work.  And I know if I look up I’ll see the sun.  And if I see it I will feel it.  And it would dry me out and lift me up.  And I’m not looking.  I’m keeping my head down.</p>
<p>And I’m scared and alone and I don’t know what I want or need.  And I want to come bare to the world and I want to find my purpose and I want to sing my song and I’m so petrified and I’m so ashamed that it took me 1 year and 4 months to find my first job and that I’ve never had a truly good job and that I feel like I am so ungreatful for wanting more.  I have been passed over.  I have been missed.  How did I slip through the cracks?  I am a quiet one.  Yet every day has new possibility.  Where is the discipline – Mr. Karate master is many miles away.  Many people care about me and I care about many people.  So why am I like this?</p>

<h2>2/12/2020</h2>
<p>The mountains are seeping, weeping.  Into the vast alone.  In search of a tale of trails untamed and minds unmaimed.  A warm hug on a cold morning.  I begin anew.  I’ll begin as you, I’ll end as me - a me that can be seen but not described.  The days are long and strong and care must be taken every step.  The miles go on and on and on like the voices of the others so steadily filling my head that my own thoughts suffocate.  At my own pace they’ll break free.  The thoughts.  She said It’ll build you up and tear you down again and again and again.  Life does it too but hiking does it faster.</p>
<p>At the end I’ll get a cat.  A cat to love and to hold.  A cat to care for.  A cat to play with.  Into the warm zone where I can hopefully thrive and know that discipline can take me there.  Wherever there is tomorrow, I don’t know.  I hope I love it there but I’m always learning and I need to be challenged.</p>

<h2>2/2/2020</h2>
<p>Your mind my mind our minds.  Throat is sore from talking.  Nose is running.  Time is coming shaking hands was long ago.  Alone on my bus I am proud to be alive I am proud of my learning experiences and proud of my chance I didn’t blow it this time but I always almost do.  Replays, replays.  In them I find a smile.  The sky is clear and clean.  Someone is there, I wonder who it is.  And I stare down at my fingers and my paper.</p>

<h2>1/30/2020</h2>
<p>I flipped the wanderer up and my heart dropped.  Is she really wandering if we keep bumping into each other?  She points to the ditch and watches as I scramble down to say hello to the humble daisy.  No matter where I go I will have to leave it behind.  I want to go with the wanderer and skip and climb trees.  I want to sing with her.  Sit with her by firelight and ward off the chill by simply being present.  I want to shiver with her under cloudy skies and clap along with the thunder.  I want to slip through the surface of a lake in the dead of the night and feel the fish nibbling at my toes as I wash.  I want my face to be carved by the wind and my hair to grow like the mane of a wild horse.  Spirit.  My bones creak as I straighten up.  The wanderer is gone and I don’t know where to go.  Maybe I’ll see her at the next junction.  Until then, I wave goodbye to the daisy and I’m on my own.</p>

<h2>1/20/2020</h2>
<p>It's hard not to write about people.  Because I am a person.  And whatever I write has that flavor, of human.  Fingers and Toes.  Trapped, I am trapped.  It is a part of the experience.  To test these boundaries.  Streatch that brain.  Sing our songs and feel our truth.</p>
<p>YES Today.  It's always today.  "What about me?" asks good night.  No - there are no breaks.  There is no pause.  There is only rythym, only beat.  Lemon and Thyme.  Skipping down the street.</p>

<h2>1/13/2020</h2>
<p>What does it feel like to be creative?  When I’m being creative it feels like I am taking care of myself.  A new bud crackles through the crust of my skin and it’s tiny and green and catches my gaze.  As I watch it bends and sways, working its way out into the air and unfurling its leaves.  A deep breath in, my vision takes over.  I know what to do without using words, transcending language and entering a swirling world of intuition.  This goes there, that needs to be adjusted.  And I think it could use some more glue or more blue.  I try and swap and make until it is done, if art can ever be done.  Because once it’s released it grows older, the leaves might age and the color changes as the background fades away.  To me, an apple.  To you, an orange.  And art can be anything from the way I placed the pineapple on my pizza to the way I arranged parts on my mechanical drawing, to the way I say hello when you get home.</p>

<h2>1/8/2020</h2>
<p>When I'm happy I think about the beauty around me.  The way the bricks were laid on a retaining wall, framing the flowers.  The color green.  The meow of a cat.  A smile from a friend.  Turning inside there is beauty within.  A glowing light is switched on and anything dark and scary hides, or withers, or loses track of its shadow.  Bouncy balls dart around angular caverns illuminating crystals I've never seen.  A warm breath of water fills my limbs and the light from the sun sifts through gentile waves and into my heart.  Thank you for this day.   Thank you for this moment.  Thank you for the color green.</p>

<h2>12/12/2019</h2>
<p>My twin would be better than me, if I had one.  My twin would be less boring.  I'm painting on the back of my canvas where no one can see the shaky brushstrokes.  My twin stands tall in the crowd and wears a swirling dress of many colors.  I sit on a stiff chair with a stiff back writing about tomorrow until my hand cramps.  My twin pulls on her boots and walks through the rain and mud in search of her rainbow.  I lay on the ground thinking of the outside.  And how I could be doing yoga.  My twin sreatches every day so she can touch her toes and bend over backwards.  My twin wears nice clothes that make her feel fearless.  She has a nice smile and short, funny stories to share with her friends.  Her blue eyes look back at me in the mirror.  A promise, a wish, a wondering... what if?</p>

<h2>11/8/2019</h2>
<p>I am lost.  I’m not found.  Maybe someday someone will discover me, pluck me out of a bin of oranges in the supermarket and I’ll be ripe, tangy, sweet, strong.  Colorful.  The days drag on and my skin is peeling.  Bottom of the barrel comes and goes.  Person after person passes me by.  I’m toppled to the floor by a child.  It hurt, but he didn’t mean it.  Still, I’m bruised.  Wheels fly left, screech right.  I’m bumped and rolled and kicked till I start leaking juice.  Night comes and the dark is cold under the fake lights of the produce section.  Thunder rolls in, the mist rolls over the cabbage shelf and down in a waterfall onto my head.  The tears bead and swell, cascading to the floor.  I close my eyes.  A shadow passes over me, slowing.  Warm fingers close around me.  Shivering me, slimy me, sorry me, forgotten me.  Is it time to go home?</p>

<h2>10/30/2019</h2>
<p>Foot on the ground, knee in the air, hand up high, fingers open.  They close around a leaf as I fall back down.  Small brown splotches, problems that grew over time.  A relationship built and broken.  Selfishness is so common when one is hurt.  He is hurt, perhaps not broken, not yet.  But healing takes time and he has at once no time and all the time in the world.</p>
<p>The leaf’s canvas is golden yellow fading to egg yolk.  The end of a journey, I cut it short.  The ribs, the structure, soothes me as I feel its patterns.  A deep breath in, my body relaxed.  I am one with myself.  I need not others to define me, it is coming from within.  A warm glow growing like a newly-kindled fire, warding off the frost of fall.  I am okay.  Even good.  Young me wouldn’t have stood up for myself.  Young me wouldn’t have left.  Young me would’ve let myself break, poor me.  I love young me, but I love now me more.  Now me smiles at the sun and cries with the rain.  Now me skips like the child she is.  Now me sings out of tune.  Now me is thoughtful, creative, and expressive.  Always learning and ever sharing, when she’s ready.  Now me loves being a woman, and now me is at risk for becoming an advocate for women’s rights, because she believes in women.  Now me has her stuff together, mostly.  Love you WOMAN!</p>

<h2>10/11/2019</h2>
<p>Ho-dee-ho-dee-hoh!</p>
<p>I knew I’d find you there, bigfoot.  Immortalized stone toes attached to the top of the mountain.  I found you there.  I was afraid to find you and I still am.  The rocks poke my legs and hands until I cannot help but to reach down and caress them one-by-one.  I let the sand drift away into the sky.  Rocks fall down, the grain to my life.  The stones have grain from flowing and bubbling.  They have faucets from fractured faces.  In the spring I know they weep with the going of the snows.  And the sun scorches their faces.  Tumbling off of the peaks to dribble into the lake below.  I am alone with myself.  I love rocks.  And rocks love me.  They try to hug me often but only scrape my knees.  I didn’t talk to anyone, except bigfoot.  I warned him I was coming.  Ho-dee-ho-dee-hoh.</p>
<p>I pause.  Where to go next?  How to best enjoy those moments of alone, of play, of returning to my roots.  Of finding who I am through how I choose to interact with the world.  How to capture, how to record, remember.  Does it need to be remembered?</p>

<h2>10/11/2019</h2>
<p>I don’t know how to share myself.  I hardly know myself.  My brother sees my essence better than anyone.  If I share myself will I lose myself?  Will I find who I am or only more of who I am not?  Why is that stubborn pride so ever present.  Labeled as selfish, am I not allowed to be me if me is selfish?  Allowed by who, if I am the master of my life my number one goal is to be what I am meant to be to grow and flow and burst through the lid of my jar like a sourdough starter.  To bake loaf after creative loaf.  A living culture cultivated, a wholesome colony of good keeping out the bad.  My smells travel through the world, I supply  happy life to many people.</p>
