<h1>Sunrise Solo: A Blog</h1>

<h2>11/8/2019</h2>
<p>I am lost.  I’m not found.  Maybe someday someone will discover me, pluck me out of a bin of oranges in the supermarket and I’ll be ripe, tangy, sweet, strong.  Colorful.  The days drag on and my skin is peeling.  Bottom of the barrel comes and goes.  Person after person passes me by.  I’m toppled to the floor by a child.  It hurt, but he didn’t mean it.  Still, I’m bruised.  Wheels fly left, screech right.  I’m bumped and rolled and kicked till I start leaking juice.  Night comes and the dark is cold under the fake lights of the produce section.  Thunder rolls in, the mist rolls over the cabbage shelf and down in a waterfall onto my head.  The tears bead and swell, cascading to the floor.  I close my eyes.  A shadow passes over me, slowing.  Warm fingers close around me.  Shivering me, slimy me, sorry me, forgotten me.  Is it time to go home?</p>

<p>Foot on the ground, knee in the air, hand up high, fingers open.  They close around a leaf as I fall back down.  Small brown splotches, problems that grew over time.  A relationship built and broken.  Selfishness is so common when one is hurt.  He is hurt, perhaps not broken, not yet.  But healing takes time and he has at once no time and all the time in the world.</p>
<p>The leaf’s canvas is golden yellow fading to egg yolk.  The end of a journey, I cut it short.  The ribs, the structure, soothes me as I feel its patterns.  A deep breath in, my body relaxed.  I am one with myself.  I need not others to define me, it is coming from within.  A warm glow growing like a newly-kindled fire, warding off the frost of fall.  I am okay.  Even good.  Young me wouldn’t have stood up for myself.  Young me wouldn’t have left.  Young me would’ve let myself break, poor me.  I love young me, but I love now me more.  Now me smiles at the sun and cries with the rain.  Now me skips like the child she is.  Now me sings out of tune.  Now me is thoughtful, creative, and expressive.  Always learning and ever sharing, when she’s ready.  Now me loves being a woman, and now me is at risk for becoming an advocate for women’s rights, because she believes in women.  Now me has her stuff together, mostly.  Love you WOMAN!</p>

<p>Ho-dee-ho-dee-hoh!</p>
<p>I knew I’d find you there, bigfoot.  Immortalized stone toes attached to the top of the mountain.  I found you there.  I was afraid to find you and I still am.  The rocks poke my legs and hands until I cannot help but to reach down and caress them one-by-one.  I let the sand drift away into the sky.  Rocks fall down, the grain to my life.  The stones have grain from flowing and bubbling.  They have faucets from fractured faces.  In the spring I know they weep with the going of the snows.  And the sun scorches their faces.  Tumbling off of the peaks to dribble into the lake below.  I am alone with myself.  I love rocks.  And rocks love me.  They try to hug me often but only scrape my knees.  I didn’t talk to anyone, except bigfoot.  I warned him I was coming.  Ho-dee-ho-dee-hoh.</p>
<p>I pause.  Where to go next?  How to best enjoy those moments of alone, of play, of returning to my roots.  Of finding who I am through how I choose to interact with the world.  How to capture, how to record, remember.  Does it need to be remembered?</p>

<p>I don’t know how to share myself.  I hardly know myself.  My brother sees my essence better than anyone.  If I share myself will I lose myself?  Will I find who I am or only more of who I am not?  Why is that stubborn pride so ever present.  Labeled as selfish, am I not allowed to be me if me is selfish?  Allowed by who, if I am the master of my life my number one goal is to be what I am meant to be to grow and flow and burst through the lid of my jar like a sourdough starter.  To bake loaf after creative loaf.  A living culture cultivated, a wholesome colony of good keeping out the bad.  My smells travel through the world, I supply  happy life to many people.</p>
