<h1>Sunrise Solo: A Blog</h1>

<h2>1/20/2020</h2>
<p>It's hard not to write about people.  Because I am a person.  And whatever I write has that flavor, of human.  Fingers and Toes.  Trapped, I am trapped.  It is a part of the experience.  To test these boundaries.  Streatch that brain.  Sing our songs and feel our truth.</p>
<p>YES Today.  It's always today.  "What about me?" asks good night.  No - there are no breaks.  There is no pause.  There is only rythym, only beat.  Lemon and Thyme.  Skipping down the street.</p>

<p>What does it feel like to be creative?  When I’m being creative it feels like I am taking care of myself.  A new bud crackles through the crust of my skin and it’s tiny and green and catches my gaze.  As I watch it bends and sways, working its way out into the air and unfurling its leaves.  A deep breath in, my vision takes over.  I know what to do without using words, transcending language and entering a swirling world of intuition.  This goes there, that needs to be adjusted.  And I think it could use some more glue or more blue.  I try and swap and make until it is done, if art can ever be done.  Because once it’s released it grows older, the leaves might age and the color changes as the background fades away.  To me, an apple.  To you, an orange.  And art can be anything from the way I placed the pineapple on my pizza to the way I arranged parts on my mechanical drawing, to the way I say hello when you get home.</p>

<h2>1/8/2020</h2>
<p>When I'm happy I think about the beauty around me.  The way the bricks were laid on a retaining wall, framing the flowers.  The color green.  The meow of a cat.  A smile from a friend.  Turning inside there is beauty within.  A glowing light is switched on and anything dark and scary hides, or withers, or loses track of its shadow.  Bouncy balls dart around angular caverns illuminating crystals I've never seen.  A warm breath of water fills my limbs and the light from the sun sifts through gentile waves and into my heart.  Thank you for this day.   Thank you for this moment.  Thank you for the color green.</p>

<p>My twin would be better than me, if I had one.  My twin would be less boring.  I'm painting on the back of my canvas where no one can see the shaky brushstrokes.  My twin stands tall in the crowd and wears a swirling dress of many colors.  I sit on a stiff chair with a stiff back writing about tomorrow until my hand cramps.  My twin pulls on her boots and walks through the rain and mud in search of her rainbow.  I lay on the ground thinking of the outside.  And how I could be doing yoga.  My twin sreatches every day so she can touch her toes and bend over backwards.  My twin wears nice clothes that make her feel fearless.  She has a nice smile and short, funny stories to share with her friends.  Her blue eyes look back at me in the mirror.  A promise, a wish, a wondering... what if?</p>

<h2>11/8/2019</h2>
<p>I am lost.  I’m not found.  Maybe someday someone will discover me, pluck me out of a bin of oranges in the supermarket and I’ll be ripe, tangy, sweet, strong.  Colorful.  The days drag on and my skin is peeling.  Bottom of the barrel comes and goes.  Person after person passes me by.  I’m toppled to the floor by a child.  It hurt, but he didn’t mean it.  Still, I’m bruised.  Wheels fly left, screech right.  I’m bumped and rolled and kicked till I start leaking juice.  Night comes and the dark is cold under the fake lights of the produce section.  Thunder rolls in, the mist rolls over the cabbage shelf and down in a waterfall onto my head.  The tears bead and swell, cascading to the floor.  I close my eyes.  A shadow passes over me, slowing.  Warm fingers close around me.  Shivering me, slimy me, sorry me, forgotten me.  Is it time to go home?</p>

<h2>10/30/2019</h2>
<p>Foot on the ground, knee in the air, hand up high, fingers open.  They close around a leaf as I fall back down.  Small brown splotches, problems that grew over time.  A relationship built and broken.  Selfishness is so common when one is hurt.  He is hurt, perhaps not broken, not yet.  But healing takes time and he has at once no time and all the time in the world.</p>
<p>The leaf’s canvas is golden yellow fading to egg yolk.  The end of a journey, I cut it short.  The ribs, the structure, soothes me as I feel its patterns.  A deep breath in, my body relaxed.  I am one with myself.  I need not others to define me, it is coming from within.  A warm glow growing like a newly-kindled fire, warding off the frost of fall.  I am okay.  Even good.  Young me wouldn’t have stood up for myself.  Young me wouldn’t have left.  Young me would’ve let myself break, poor me.  I love young me, but I love now me more.  Now me smiles at the sun and cries with the rain.  Now me skips like the child she is.  Now me sings out of tune.  Now me is thoughtful, creative, and expressive.  Always learning and ever sharing, when she’s ready.  Now me loves being a woman, and now me is at risk for becoming an advocate for women’s rights, because she believes in women.  Now me has her stuff together, mostly.  Love you WOMAN!</p>

<p>Ho-dee-ho-dee-hoh!</p>
<p>I knew I’d find you there, bigfoot.  Immortalized stone toes attached to the top of the mountain.  I found you there.  I was afraid to find you and I still am.  The rocks poke my legs and hands until I cannot help but to reach down and caress them one-by-one.  I let the sand drift away into the sky.  Rocks fall down, the grain to my life.  The stones have grain from flowing and bubbling.  They have faucets from fractured faces.  In the spring I know they weep with the going of the snows.  And the sun scorches their faces.  Tumbling off of the peaks to dribble into the lake below.  I am alone with myself.  I love rocks.  And rocks love me.  They try to hug me often but only scrape my knees.  I didn’t talk to anyone, except bigfoot.  I warned him I was coming.  Ho-dee-ho-dee-hoh.</p>
<p>I pause.  Where to go next?  How to best enjoy those moments of alone, of play, of returning to my roots.  Of finding who I am through how I choose to interact with the world.  How to capture, how to record, remember.  Does it need to be remembered?</p>

<h2>10/11/2019</h2>
<p>I don’t know how to share myself.  I hardly know myself.  My brother sees my essence better than anyone.  If I share myself will I lose myself?  Will I find who I am or only more of who I am not?  Why is that stubborn pride so ever present.  Labeled as selfish, am I not allowed to be me if me is selfish?  Allowed by who, if I am the master of my life my number one goal is to be what I am meant to be to grow and flow and burst through the lid of my jar like a sourdough starter.  To bake loaf after creative loaf.  A living culture cultivated, a wholesome colony of good keeping out the bad.  My smells travel through the world, I supply  happy life to many people.</p>
